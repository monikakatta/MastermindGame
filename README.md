# MastermindGame
->*The idea of the game is for one player (the code-breaker) to guess the secret code chosen by the other player(system).

->*The code is a sequence of 3 colored pegs chosen from 4 colors available.

->*The code-breaker makes a serie of pattern guesses - after each guess the code-maker gives feedback in the form of 2 numbers.

->*The number of pegs that are of the right color and in the correct position are represented by  green pegs.

->*The number of pegs that are of the correct color but not in the correct position represented by red pegs.
